# tools-workshops

The tools team is holding a series of design workshops to help plan future development for specific topics. Each workshop will include a presentation on the topic and the various components, current requirements, known issues, existing plans and ideas, then progress into a general discussion. Each workshop would result in one or more writeups that can referred to as plans develop and in future community discussions. To the extent possible, recordings of the workshops will be made available.

Currently, these are being coordinated as 2-3 hour online sessions, open to all.

This repository will hold pointers to the results of [past workshops](past_workshops.md), and proposals for future ones.
